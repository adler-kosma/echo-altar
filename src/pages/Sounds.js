As I did not have time to tell him just how much this meant and came to mean for me I interpreted one of our creations from 2014 to try and honor that everything which we once shared. This is a new and a last and a lonely For BDK. Through me alone and through that which I am today. I take your hand, I am going to lead you home. Rest in peace dear.

The rich and colourful bends for the iterations. In mutual understanding, mutual pleasure, the two worlds of material meet. Misunderstandings occur, but at no loss. Between every hit there is a window, an opening, and in every glance I have found something new. I have thoroughly searched to find the very core of this place, my findings will be presented in 'if it were for me you'd piece me up'"},
